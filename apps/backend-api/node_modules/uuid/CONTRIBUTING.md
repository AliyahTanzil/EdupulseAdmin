## Releasing

Releases are supposed to be done from master, version bumping is automated through [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version):

```shell
npm run release -- --dry-run  # verify output manually
npm run release               # follow the instructions from the output of this command
```
